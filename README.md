# scratchpad
I wanted a scratchpad. Something that is lightweight. And is always there at my fingertip in my terminal.

So, I wrote one, because It is better to write one from scratch, rather than spend hours in looking for something that suits my needs. And then spend hours in installation, resolving the dependency and learning.

I wrote this in two hours from scratch. And, in current shape it full-fills my all of my needs.

It is not perfect, I will keep adding new features, if needed.

Currently it provides following features.

1. Clear the screen -> cleans all the data on the screen
2. Undo the clear screen -> Currently, only latest cleared screen is resotred
3. Exit -> exits the application.

Initial Window. This is opening of the application

The cursor is free flowing. You can move the cursor whereever you want. There is no need to put whitespace or tabs .. just press the arrow keys and move.

And, we can use mouse to point and click to move cursor to the desired location.
